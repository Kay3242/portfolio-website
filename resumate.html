            Resumate is a conceptual prototype for an AI-powered resume and portfolio builder designed for creative professionals. The platform streamlines the process of showcasing work by allowing users to sketch, generate, and customize templates tailored to their field—whether it's design, photography, or engineering.

        <p class="description">
            The login and signup flows were designed for simplicity and clarity, using minimal fields and clean alignment. Microcopy and visual hierarchy were tested to minimize friction, especially for users who may be less experienced with digital platforms.

            The interface was designed with intuitive sidebar navigation for quick access to key features like templates, sketches, and user projects. The layout prioritizes ease of use, with personalized content suggestions and a prominent “Create New Design” button to encourage user action.

        <p class="description">
            The AI Sketchpad allows users to visually map out design ideas, which can then be auto-translated into layout templates. Basic drawing and editing tools mimic the feel of a physical sketchbook, while the “Generate” function bridges creativity with AI automation.

        <p class="description">
            The template page offers curated layouts categorized by topic and format (e.g., CV vs. Portfolio). Users can filter based on their creative field or build their own from scratch. This section was informed by research on common pain points in early-career portfolio creation.
        </p>

      <div class="project-image-block row">
        <img src="portfolio website images/resumate_6.webp" alt="project tab">
        <p class="description">
            Users can manage drafts and completed works within the Projects tab. The interface supports version saving and categorization by date or theme, allowing users to build a professional archive over time. Placeholder wireframes hint at scalable content organization.

        <p class="description">
            An interactive, step-by-step walkthrough orients first-time users. Pop-ups explain each major section (Templates, Sketches, Projects), enhancing user confidence while subtly reinforcing the tool's core capabilities. The tone remains friendly and helpful throughout.
