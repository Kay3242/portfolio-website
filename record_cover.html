        <p class="description">
          This record cover design explores themes of mental complexity and dreamlike detachment through layered visuals and abstract mark-making. The hand-drawn scribbles disrupt soft, grainy imagery to represent inner turmoil and distortion. Split into two conceptual parts, the design captures a narrative of emotional descent followed by surreal transformation.

        <p class="description">
          The sleeve design intensifies the record’s emotional tone, pairing glitchy visual distortion with the title track "Drown..." to evoke a sense of being overwhelmed or submerged. The blurred portrait and aggressive strikethrough convey internal chaos, aligning with the album’s darker themes. Paired with a carefully typeset lyrics sheet, the sleeve invites listeners to engage more deeply with the album’s emotional narrative—one that moves between disorientation and fragile clarity.

        <p class="description">
          The vinyl labels continue the album’s visual narrative, using distorted photography and hand-drawn scribbles to evoke themes of dissociation and identity. Each side reflects a different emotional phase—one submerged and dreamlike, the other more confrontational and obscured. The imagery is deliberately raw, enhancing the concept of psychological unraveling across the record's two parts.

        <p class="description">
          These mockups present the full vinyl packaging system, showcasing how the conceptual design translates into a cohesive physical product. From the gatefold cover to the dual-disc layout, each element reinforces the album’s emotional arc—blending lo-fi textures, scribbled distortions, and dreamlike imagery. The design immerses the viewer in a world of disorientation and self-reflection, while maintaining a strong visual identity across all physical components.

        <p class="description">
          These concert posters were designed to extend the album’s visual identity into promotional materials for a fictional Australian tour. Using consistent color palettes, blurred imagery, and scribbled obscuration, the posters evoke a haunting, ethereal mood that mirrors the themes of the record. The typographic treatment and layout variations explore how emotional tone can be communicated across both minimal and detailed compositions in a public-facing format.

        <p class="description">
          To extend the visual identity beyond print, I developed a set of branding mockups including water bottles, concert tickets, and a tote bag. Each item integrates the album’s surreal aesthetic through grainy imagery, muted tones, and expressive black scribbles. The designs emphasize emotional resonance while maintaining visual cohesion across both merchandise and promotional collateral, creating a fully immersive brand experience.
