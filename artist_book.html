            “Unfolding Memories” is a series of three artist books that extend the themes of space, memory, and perception explored in my stop motion film. Each format—accordion, jar, and scroll—translates temporal motion into tactile narrative, offering physical interpretations of fragmented thought and emotional space.

          This hand-bound accordion book weaves together architectural landmarks and typographic experiments to explore diasporic identity across space. As the pages unfold, layers of cultural memory and language converge in a tactile narrative of place, belonging, and visual heritage. The format allows viewers to physically travel through intertwined personal and historical landscapes.

        <p class="description">
          Rendered in bold brushstrokes on traditional paper, this calligraphic piece reclaims spatial identity through language. The characters “外空” (Outer Space) evoke both physical and metaphysical distance, bridging East Asian cultural aesthetics with philosophical inquiry. The use of ink and scroll format grounds the conceptual in the deeply material.

        <p class="description">
          This interactive sculpture captures fragments of lost language and sentiment in a USB-lit jar of folded paper cranes and hidden text. Tied with a ribbon and tagged with its poetic title, Flightpath of Forgotten Words invites viewers to reflect on how memory, language, and meaning are preserved—or buried—through time. It functions as both keepsake and archive.

            This hand-constructed scroll book was developed as part of Trouble Books 2025, exploring the relationship between materiality and memory. The work integrates calligraphic gestures and layered folds to evoke the act of remembrance as a physical and spatial process.
