            This project explores the spatial and visual potential of iterative surface manipulation using parametric tools in Rhino. Beginning with grid deformation influenced by point and curve attractors, the study developed into a series of complex surface assemblies composed of custom panels. Each variation responds to different attractor logics, generating dynamic textures that mimic organic growth, motion, and density. The final renders showcase two distinct surface conditions—one sharp and crystalline, the other layered and vegetal—demonstrating the versatility of rule-based design systems.

            This surface was modeled in Rhino as a digital interpretation of a plant's micro-contour. The form responds to specific upward pulls and downward compressions mapped from a close-up plant texture, creating tension across the surface. By mimicking organic distortions, the design explores how biological structure can inform spatial articulation and architectural surface logic.        </p>

            This series explores the relationship between parametric grids, attractor logic, and panelized surface articulation using Grasshopper in Rhino. Grid studies (left) investigate point and curve attractors with varying magnitudes and shuffle behaviors. Panel studies (center) apply custom shapes and bounding logic in response to those attractors. The hybrid combinations (right) synthesize both strategies to produce responsive surface fields with spatial and visual complexity. This iterative approach allowed for precise control over pattern density, rhythm, and topographic expression.        </p>

            These colour-edited renders reframe the original parametric surfaces through a new atmospheric lens. By manipulating hue and contrast in post-production, the studies shift from technical analysis to visual experimentation—highlighting materiality, light, and emotion. The altered palettes enhance spatial rhythm and texture, transforming the forms into expressive landscapes.        </p>

            This diagram isolates and analyzes key panel geometries from a custom parametric surface. Using attractor-based deformation, select modules were highlighted and extracted to study their spatial behavior, triangulation logic, and bounding conditions. The surrounding wireframe diagrams reveal the formal logic behind each panel’s subdivision, offering insight into how curvature and modularity inform fabrication potential.        </p>
