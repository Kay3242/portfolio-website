        <p class="description">
            This fan-made redesign reimagines the Sky: Children of the Light website to enhance clarity, usability, and emotional engagement. The homepage design prioritizes immersion with a large hero image and streamlined top nav bar. The Figma auto-layout and prototyping tools were used to build responsive frames and interactive flows, including hover states and call-to-action transitions like the “Play Sky” button.        </p>

        <p class="description">
            The full interface was designed in Figma, using a component-based system to maintain consistency across screens while allowing for iterative layout testing and visual refinement.        </p>

        <p class="description">
            Game content is organized into clear categories—Outfits, Lore, Events, Guides, and Locations—each designed as reusable components in Figma. This system enabled quick scaling and consistent spacing across card layouts, with each icon vectorized and styled directly within Figma.

      <div class="project-image-block row">
        <img src="portfolio website images/sky_4.webp" alt="event">
        <p class="description">
            The event section features card-style previews styled using Figma’s component variants, allowing for different states (e.g. new, archived, featured). Cards were visually tested using Figma’s prototype model to simulate hover and click behavior, ensuring smooth user navigation across dynamic updates.

        <img src="portfolio website images/sky_5.webp" alt="socials">
        <p class="description">
            Social icons and footer components were constructed as reusable elements in Figma and placed using constraints to adapt across screen sizes. The footer and community sections maintain hierarchy and spacing through Figma’s grid and alignment tools for a clean, balanced finish.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-image-block row">
        <img src="portfolio website images/sky_6.webp" alt="figma2">
        <p class="description">
            Design iterations were conducted within Figma using commenting features for peer feedback, color token testing, and wireframe overlays to compare mid-fidelity and high-fidelity outputs. Prototyping also allowed me to test scroll flow and screen transitions directly within the tool.
