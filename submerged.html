            This speculative 3D environment explores how jellyfish—often overlooked or miscast as invasive—could serve as ecological agents in a submerged rewilding of Professor’s Walk at the University of Melbourne. The work reimagines institutional space as one that embraces non-human agency, fluidity, and environmental hybridity.

            Using Blender, I recreated a stylised underwater version of Professor’s Walk. Procedural terrain sculpting and adaptive lighting simulations were used to generate depth and realism in the seabed and coral structures. Elements like ruins and tunnels were preserved from the original path, now overtaken by aquatic life.

        <p class="description">
            Jellyfish were sculpted with soft-surface modifiers and displacement textures, then animated with simple bone rigs and motion paths to simulate their floating presence. These agents act as poetic disruptors—calm yet alien—reshaping how we perceive agency, movement, and adaptation in urban ecological design.

            This animation explores the fluid, organic motion of jellyfish as they pulse through water. By focusing on soft body dynamics and tentacle behavior, the piece aims to replicate the natural ebb and flow of underwater movement. The monochrome render emphasizes form and rhythm over realism, highlighting the elegance of motion itself.        </p>

            Supporting biodiversity was visualised through generative coral formations, particle-based sea anemones, and rigged clownfish groups. These elements build a layered, multispecies system reflecting entanglement and interdependence, contrasting the linear order of human-controlled space.

            This work was selected and exhibited as part of <i>MSDx Summer 2024</i>, the University of Melbourne’s Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning showcase. Presented within the Digital Futures stream, it highlighted how speculative environmental modeling can provoke dialogue around ecological futures, urban rewilding, and posthuman design ethics.
