            This piece is part of an exploratory mark making series focused on contrast and controlled chaos. Using ink, stencils, and gestural tools, the composition balances bold structure with expressive spontaneity. The layered red and black forms invite interpretation as both abstract visual language and emotional texture.

            This piece reinterprets earlier gestures through inversion and contrast, amplifying the energy of each mark against a deep black ground. Bold white strokes and textured fragments create dynamic tension, while the curved red arc slices through the composition, anchoring movement and direction. The result is a layered exploration of rhythm, force, and negative space.        </p>

        <p class="description">
            This mirrored composition explores duality through contrast, symmetry, and digital intervention. Ink-based marks are split and inverted across a vertical axis, with subtle color overlays grounding the tension between organic motion and graphic structure. The piece plays with balance and fragmentation, offering a visual dialogue between opposing states: fluid vs. fixed, analog vs. digital, light vs. shadow.

        <p class="description">
            This high-contrast composition explores rhythm, repetition, and disruption through gestural white marks over a black field. The image is split into two contrasting textures—scraped vs. fluid—creating a dynamic visual tension. The addition of red linear accents interrupts the flow, acting as visual noise or signal, and injecting a sense of urgency into the abstract structure.        </p>

            This composition explores visual harmony through layered gestural marks and selective color. The interplay of soft yellow blocks, pale cyan curves, and sweeping white strokes creates movement across a dark field without overwhelming it. By combining bold brushwork with delicate overlays, the piece investigates how structure, spontaneity, and palette can coexist in compositional balance.

            This mockup showcases a final spread from the mark making book, designed to unfold as a continuous, immersive landscape of expressive gestures. The bold use of black, white, and red amplifies contrast and rhythm, guiding the viewer’s eye across each fold. The spread captures the core themes of movement, disruption, and layered texture, tying together analog spontaneity with a refined compositional flow.        </p>
